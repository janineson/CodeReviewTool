# Code Review Metrics Tool for SmartThings
<i>Software Language Lab, Computer Science, Sookmyung Womenâ€™s University</i>

This is a metrics tool analyzer based on the HTML report generated by CodeNarc after running to automate the code review for SmartApps.
It displays the violations detected for each SmartApp based from CodeNarc custom rules.<br/>
It also has a summary at the bottom part of the report (text file).

# How to Run
You only need the HTML file generated from CodeNarc to run this program.<br/>
To generate the HTML report, you would need to do a few things.<br/>
You need to run another program located in a different repository (CodenarcPluginRunTest).<br/>
It is a program that contains groovy SmartApps and they are run using CodeNarc Plugin for IntellijIDEA IDE. <br/>
You need to run an ANT build file that is configured for CodeNarc and it will generate an HTML report after analyzing a bunch of SmartApps all at once.<br/>
Place the HTML file under out/dump_html folder.<br/>
Run the program.<br/>
A text file will be generated in the root folder of the source program.<br/>
