# Code Review Evaluation Tool for SmartThings
<i>Software Language Lab, Computer Science, Sookmyung Womenâ€™s University</i>

This is a code review evaluation tool that uses the HTML report generated by CodeNarc after running the automatic code review tool for SmartApps.
It displays the violations detected for each SmartApp based from CodeNarc custom rules.<br/>
It displays the total code defect rate (per KLOC) and rate for each quality attribute - Reliability, Maintainability, and Security of the SmartApp source code.<br/>
It also has a summary at the bottom part of the report (text file).

# How to Run
You need the HTML file generated from CodeNarc to run this program.<br/>
To generate the HTML report, you would need to do a few things.<br/>
You need to run another program located in a different repository (CodenarcPluginRunTest).<br/>
It is a program that contains groovy SmartApps and they are run using CodeNarc Plugin for IntellijIDEA IDE. <br/>
You need to run an ANT build file that is configured for CodeNarc and it will generate an HTML report after analyzing a bunch of SmartApps all at once.<br/>
Place the HTML file under out/dump_html folder.<br/>
Run the program.<br/>
A text file will be generated in the root folder of the source program.<br/>

# How to Run Executable Jar file
The files under deploy can be copied in any directory.
Make sure the out/dump_html folder exists and contains the CodeNarc HTML file.
Open command line and type 'java -jar CodeReviewTool.jar'
Wait until the process is done.
It will output a text file named codereviewout.txt in the root.
